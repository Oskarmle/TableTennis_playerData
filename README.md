# Hobby project to display data from my table tennis club

The project is using a python webscraper collecting data from [bordtennisportalen.dk](https://www.bordtennisportalen.dk/) and then storing the data in a MongoDB Cluster

The front-end is basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and is utilizing a GET Request to fetch the data from MongoDB
Vercel is being used to host the front-end, and is avaliable here [gbtkholdspiller](https://gbtkholdspiller.vercel.app/)

The back-end is using Node.js with Express to handle the basic CRUD requests.
